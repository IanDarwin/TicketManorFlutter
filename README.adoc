= TicketManorFlutter, a.k.a. ticket_manor_flutter

TicketManor client reimagined as a Flutter mobile app.

This is intended to, and someday will, work with the TicketManor REST service at TicketManor.com.

At present, that service is undergoing maintenance, and, at any rate, this code
doesn't exactly line up with the REST outputs from there. At least it gets
an empty list of Events from the server. To be continued...
